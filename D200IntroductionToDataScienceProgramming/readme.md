# DATASCI 200: Introduction to Data Science Programming
Final Project – Global and U.S. Disaster Trends Analysi

Course Context
This project was completed as part of Data Science 200: Introduction to Data Science Programming (D200) at UC Berkeley’s Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program. D200 provides foundational training in Python programming and data analysis, covering:

- Core Python programming (data types, control structures, object-oriented concepts)
- Data manipulation and analysis using NumPy and pandas
- Version control using Git and GitHub
- Project-based learning simulating real-world data science workflows

The course emphasizes hands-on coding and software development best practices, preparing students for advanced data science applications.

Project Overview:
=================
This project analyzes disaster data to identify geographic locations, both globally and within the U.S., that are most impacted by disasters. Key objectives include examining the total number and duration of disasters, the number of people affected, and the financial damages incurred. The project also explores the most common types of disasters and investigates patterns in their frequency and timing, providing insights into disaster trends and impacts.

DataSet:
=======
Primary Dataset : Primary Dataset: https://www.emdat.be/
Alternate Dataset : https://weltrisikobericht.de/worldriskreport/

Key questions:
=============
● Do climate change milestones, such as rising temperatures and increased carbon
emissions, influence the frequency of disasters?
● Does disaster readiness have any effect on the number of people displaced during a
natural disaster?
● Do certain types of disasters lead to greater economic losses and higher numbers of
refugees than others?
● Which regions, both in the U.S. and globally, emerge as the most resilient and desirable
places to live in the context of natural disaster risks?
a. What are the global patterns in natural and technological disasters, comparing
across countries, continents, and U.S. states?
b. What types of disasters have been recorded worldwide to date?
c. How do storm patterns and trends compare globally, within the U.S., and
specifically in Florida?
d. During which time of year do storms most frequently impact Florida and the
southeastern U.S. coast?
Assumption :
i. Season Definition : Winter is considered December, January and February;
spring is March through May; summer is June through August; and fall or
autumn is September through November
ii. Southeastern States: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, as
well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands)
e. What are the trends in storm frequency and severity across the U.S.?
f. What are the trends in all types of disasters across the U.S.?
g. Which Countries and U.S. states are the least affected by natural disasters?

Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.x
- NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn


General Instructions : 
======================

1. Use following commands to install packages individually or use requirements.txt

    pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
    (Remember to add the package name along with version in this file)

2. Use config.py to add any common variables, constants 
    - This file is imported into main file.
    - To call any variable from this file simply use config.<variable name>

3. There are two dataset files for this analysis 
    a.public_emdat_Global_techNnatural.csv 
    b.state_freq_data.csv
